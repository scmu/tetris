# Tetris

A Haskell implementation of Tetris. The project is a personal exercise in using purely functional library / concepts to create interactive GUI programs. For that I wish to create a small core representing the game logic that is reasonably independent from the interface, such that it can be ported to other GUI libraries.
The current implementation is simply using [Gloss](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/gloss) for the interface.
